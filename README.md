# PROJECT - TINYAPP

URL shortner, similar to bit.ly and TinyURL.

Use `npm start` to run the application

### Project Details
This is one of the projects I completed during a two-month web development bootcamp at [Lighthouse Labs](https://lighthouselabs.ca/about) in Toronto.

The app allows you to shorten a long URL to a randomly generated 6-character string.

Technologies used:
  * Javascript
  * MongoDB

Completed in Week 2 of our 8-week bootcamp, this was our first real project built from scratch. Super exciting when I finally got it to work!
